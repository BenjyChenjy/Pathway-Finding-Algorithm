# Pathway-Finding-Algorithm
Maintains a Graph Structure while also finding shortest path between nodes in said Graph
The following commands are available:
1. Add Vertex
2. Update Vertex
3. Delete Vertex
4. Add Edge
5. Update Edge
6. Delete Edge
7. Print All Neighbors of a Vertex
8. Print Graph
9. Print Number of Vertices
10. Print Number of Edges
11. Give the shortest path between one Vertex and all other Vertices
99. Delete All Vertices and Edges
